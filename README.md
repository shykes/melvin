- [toy-programmer](./toy-programmer): a very, very simple programmer micro-agent for demo purposes
- [melvin](./melvin): Melvin is [Devin](https://devin.ai)'s little cousin 😄. An experimental open-source coding agent, made of small composable modules rather than one monolithic app.
- [multiagent](./multiagent-demo): a demo using multiple LLMs to solve a problem
- [github-go-coder](./github-go-coder): a Go programmer micro-agent that receives assignments from GitHub issues and creates PRs with it's solutions
